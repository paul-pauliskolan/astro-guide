- **Manual location input** for any coordinates
- **Real-time sky updates** based on your location and time

### ⭐ Star Information

- **Click any star** to view detailed information
- **Star properties**: constellation, spectral class, distance, age, mass
- **Educational descriptions** for each star

### 📱 Mobile-Friendly

- **Touch controls** optimized for mobile devices
- **Responsive layout** adapts to all screen sizes
- **Large touch targets** for easy star selection on mobile

## Usage

### Basic Navigation

1. **View the sky** - The map shows stars visible from your location
2. **Zoom** - Use the +/- buttons or mouse wheel to zoom in/out
3. **Pan** - Click and drag to move around the sky
4. **Reset** - Click the home button to reset zoom and position

### Filtering Stars

1. **Adjust sliders** - Use the dual-range sliders to filter stars
2. **Real-time updates** - The map updates immediately as you change filters
3. **Reset filters** - Click "Reset All Filters" to show all stars
4. **View count** - See how many stars match your current filters

### Star Information

1. **Click any star** - Tap or click to select a star
2. **View details** - See constellation, distance, age, mass, and description
3. **Close info** - Click the × to close the information panel

### Location Settings

1. **Auto-detect** - Click "Get My Location" for automatic detection
2. **Manual input** - Enter coordinates manually if needed
3. **Privacy** - Location is only used locally, never stored or transmitted

## Star Database

## Astronomy Details

### Coordinate System

- Uses **equatorial coordinates** (Right Ascension/Declination)
- Converts to **horizontal coordinates** (Altitude/Azimuth) for display
- Calculates **Local Sidereal Time** for accurate star positions
- Accounts for **observer location** and **current time**

### Star Properties

- **Magnitude**: Apparent brightness as seen from Earth
- **Distance**: Measured in light years using parallax and other methods
- **Age**: Stellar age estimates based on stellar evolution models
- **Mass**: Solar masses (☉) - how many times heavier than our Sun
- **Spectral Class**: Star temperature and composition (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)
